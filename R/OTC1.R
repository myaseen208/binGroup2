#' @title Find the optimal testing configuration for group testing algorithms
#' that use a single-disease assay
#'
#' @description Find the optimal testing configuration (OTC) using
#' non-informative and informative hierarchical and array-based group testing
#' algorithms. Single-disease assays are used at each stage of the algorithms.
#'
#' @param algorithm character string defining the group testing algorithm to
#' be used. Non-informative testing options include two-stage hierarchical
#' ("\kbd{D2}"), three-stage hierarchical ("\kbd{D3}"), square array testing
#' without master pooling ("\kbd{A2}"), and square array testing with master
#' pooling ("\kbd{A2M}"). Informative testing options include two-stage
#' hierarchical ("\kbd{ID2}"), three-stage hierarchical ("\kbd{ID3}"), and
#' square array testing without master pooling ("\kbd{IA2}").
#' @param p overall probability of disease that will be used to generate a
#' vector/matrix of individual probabilities. For non-informative algorithms,
#' a homogeneous set of probabilities will be used. For informative
#' algorithms, the \code{\link{expectOrderBeta}} function will be used to
#' generate a heterogeneous set of probabilities. Further details are given
#' under 'Details'. Either \kbd{p} or \kbd{probabilities} should be specified,
#' but not both.
#' @param probabilities a vector of individual probabilities, which is
#' homogeneous for non-informative testing algorithms and heterogeneous for
#' informative testing algorithms. Either  \kbd{p} or \kbd{probabilities}
#' should be specified, but not both.
#' @param Se a vector of sensitivity values, where one value is given for each
#' stage of testing (in order). If a single value is provided, sensitivity
#' values are assumed to be equal to this value for all stages of testing.
#' Further details are given under 'Details'.
#' @param Sp a vector of specificity values, where one value is given for each
#' stage of testing (in order). If a single value is provided, specificity
#' values are assumed to be equal to this value for all stages of testing.
#' Further details are given under 'Details'.
#' @param group.sz a single group size or range of group sizes for which to
#' calculate operating characteristics and/or find the OTC. The details of
#' group size specification are given under 'Details'.
#' @param obj.fn a list of objective functions which are minimized to find the
#' OTC. The expected number of tests per individual, "\kbd{ET}", will always
#' be calculated. Additional options include "\kbd{MAR}"
#' (the expected number of tests divided by the expected number of correct
#' classifications, described in Malinovsky et al. (2016)), and "\kbd{GR}"
#' (a linear combination of the expected number of tests, the number of
#' misclassified negatives, and the number of misclassified positives,
#' described in Graff & Roeloffs (1972)). See Hitt et al. (2019) for
#' additional details. The first objective function specified in this list
#' will be used to determine the results for the top configurations.
#' Further details are given under 'Details'.
#' @param weights a matrix of up to six sets of weights for the GR function.
#' Each set of weights is specified by a row of the matrix.
#' @param alpha a shape parameter for the betadistribution that specifies the
#' degree of heterogeneity for the generated probability vector (for
#' informative testing only).
#' @param trace a logical value indicating whether the progress of
#' calculations should be printed for each initial group size provided by
#' the user. The default is \kbd{TRUE}.
#' @param print.time a logical value indicating whether the length of time
#' for calculations should be printed. The default is \kbd{TRUE}.
#' @param ... arguments to be passed to the \code{\link{expectOrderBeta}}
#' function, which generates a vector of probabilities for informative testing
#' algorithms. Further details are given under 'Details'.
#'
#' @details This function finds the OTC for group testing algorithms
#' with an assay that tests for one disease and computes the associated
#' operating characteristics, as described in Hitt et al. (2019).
#'
#' Available algorithms include two- and three-stage hierarchical testing and
#' array testing with and without master pooling. Both non-informative and
#' informative group testing settings are allowed for each algorithm, except
#' informative array testing with master pooling is unavailable because this
#' method has not appeared in the group testing literature. Operating
#' characteristics calculated are expected number of tests, pooling
#' sensitivity, pooling specificity, pooling positive predictive value, and
#' pooling negative predictive value for each individual.
#'
#' For informative algorithms where the \kbd{p} argument is specified, the
#' expected value of order statistics from a beta distribution are found.
#' These values are used to represent disease risk probabilities for each
#' individual to be tested. The beta distribution has two parameters: a mean
#' parameter \kbd{p} (overall disease prevalence) and a shape parameter
#' \kbd{alpha} (heterogeneity level). Depending on the specified \kbd{p},
#' \kbd{alpha}, and overall group size, simulation may be necessary to
#' generate the vector of individual probabilities. This is done using
#' \code{\link{expectOrderBeta}} and requires the user to set a seed to
#' reproduce results.
#'
#' Informative two-stage hierarchical (Dorfman) testing is implemented via
#' the pool-specific optimal Dorfman (PSOD) method described in McMahan et al.
#' (2012a), where the greedy algorithm proposed for PSOD is replaced by
#' considering all possible testing configurations. Informative array testing
#' is implemented via the gradient method (the most efficient array design),
#' where higher-risk individuals are grouped in the left-most columns of the
#' array. For additional details on the gradient arrangement method for
#' informative array testing, see McMahan et al. (2012b).
#'
#' The sensitivity/specificity values are allowed to vary across stages of
#' testing. For hierarchical testing, a different sensitivity/specificity
#' value may be used for each stage of testing. For array testing, a different
#' sensitivity/specificity value may be used for master pool testing (if
#' included), row/column testing, and individual testing. The values must be
#' specified in order of the testing performed. For example, values are
#' specified as (stage 1, stage 2, stage 3) for three-stage hierarchical
#' testing or (master pool testing, row/column testing, individual testing)
#' for array testing with master pooling. A single sensitivity/specificity
#' value may be specified instead. In this situation, sensitivity/specificity
#' values for all stages are assumed to be equal.
#'
#' The value(s) specified by \kbd{group.sz} represent the initial (stage 1)
#' group size for hierarchical testing and the row/column size for array
#' testing. For informative two-stage hierarchical testing, the \kbd{group.sz}
#' specified represents the block size used in the pool-specific optimal
#' Dorfman (PSOD) method, where the initial group (block) is not tested. For
#' more details on informative two-stage hierarchical testing implemented via
#' the PSOD method, see Hitt et al. (2019) and McMahan et al. (2012a).
#'
#' If a single value is provided for \kbd{group.sz} with array testing or
#' non-informative two-stage hierarchical testing, operating characteristics
#' will be calculated and no optimization will be performed. If a single value
#' is provided for \kbd{group.sz} with three-stage hierarchical or informative
#' two-stage hierarchical, the OTC will be found over all possible
#' configurations. If a range of group sizes is specified, the OTC will be
#' found over all group sizes.
#'
#' In addition to the OTC, operating characteristics for some of the other
#' configurations corresponding to each initial group size provided by the
#' user will be displayed. These additional configurations are only determined
#' for whichever objective function ("ET", "MAR", or "GR") is specified first
#' in the function call. If "GR" is the objective function listed first, the
#' first set of corresponding weights will be used. For algorithms where there
#' is only one configuration for each initial group size (non-informative
#' two-stage hierarchical and all array testing algorithms), results for each
#' initial group size are provided. For algorithms where there is more than
#' one possible configuration for each initial group size (informative
#' two-stage hierarchical and all three-stage hierarchical algorithms), two
#' sets of configurations are provided: 1) the best configuration for each
#' initial group size, and 2) the top 10 configurations for each initial group
#' size provided by the user. If a single value is provided for \kbd{group.sz}
#' with array testing or non-informative two-stage hierarchical testing,
#' operating characteristics will not be provided for configurations other
#' than that specified by the user. Results are sorted by the value of the
#' objective function per individual, \kbd{value}.
#'
#' The displayed overall pooling sensitivity, pooling specificity, pooling
#' positive predictive value, and pooling negative predictive value are
#' weighted averages of the corresponding individual accuracy measures for all
#' individuals within the initial group (or block) for a hierarchical
#' algorithm, or within the entire array for an array-based algorithm.
#' Expressions for these averages are provided in the Supplementary
#' Material for Hitt et al. (2019). These expressions are based on accuracy
#' definitions given by Altman and Bland (1994a, 1994b). Individual
#' accuracy measures can be calculated using the
#' \code{\link{operatingCharacteristics1}} (\code{\link{opChar1}}) function.
#'
#' The \kbd{OTC1} function accepts additional arguments, namely \kbd{num.sim},
#' to be passed to the \code{\link{expectOrderBeta}} function, which generates
#' a vector of probabilities for informative group testing algorithms. The
#' \kbd{num.sim} argument specifies the number of simulations from the beta
#' distribution when simulation is used. By default, 10,000 simulations are
#' used.

#'
#' @section Note: This function returns the pooling positive and negative
#' predictive values for all individuals even though these measures are
#' diagnostic specific; e.g., the pooling positive predictive value should
#' only be considered for those individuals who have tested positive.
#'
#' Additionally, only stage dependent sensitivity and specificity values are
#' allowed within the program (no group within stage dependent values are
#' allowed). See Bilder et al. (2019) for additional information.
